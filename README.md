Project: Deal Estate

We created a real estate dashboard that will have information on Listings and allows for user/buyer to contact the seller

Our real estate dashboard is setup as follows:

Home Page: Contains main information about our website and tells you how to navigate it
Listings: This section will have listings of properties in different municipalities of Indiana. As part of the listings, it will state Price, Address, Bedrooms, Bathrooms
Contacts: Here the buyer can reach out to the seller. This section will firstly have a place where you can input contact information and bid. There will be a list below that updates showing the bids on certain properties.
